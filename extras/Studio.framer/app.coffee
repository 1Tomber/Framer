		Our goal with Framer has always been to build a full service design tool. So while itâ€™s been possible to view working prototypes on a mobile browser, the experience has been less than seamless.

		Then, our community came to the rescue. Both Frameless by Jay Stakelon and Frames by Rafael Conde set a new standard for mobile viewing of prototypes. Inspired by their work and your feedback, we are now launching an iOS app that fully rounds out your design experience.

		Framer for iOS features live preview, offline use and intuitive sharing features that are protected by secure links. Paired with Framer for Mac, you now have access to a full mobile prototyping toolkit.
